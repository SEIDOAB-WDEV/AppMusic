Purpose:
In AppMusicRazor
Add Serverside page level Authorization and Forbid access to a page if User not authorized to access it

Steps:
1. Create a folder in Pages called Member. Move Pages EditGroup och Seed into Members 

2. Update all references to EditGroup and Seed to new location, use Find
(ViewGroup, _Layout, ListOfGroups)

3. In Program.cs set Members folder to demand Authorization for all pages in the folder
builder.Services.AddRazorPages(option =>
{
    option.Conventions.AuthorizeFolder("/Members");
});

4. In _Layout change menu link to Seed so it is only visible if User is Authenticated
@if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)

5. Execute and try to edit with and without being logged in

6. Notice that Delete group is still working, why?
